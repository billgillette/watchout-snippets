Another option would be to add the "-TweenSampleMs TimeInMilliseconds" argument to Watchpoint, where TimeInMilliseconds would be something larger than the default interval (100 ms), for example "-TweenSampleMs 1000" to increase the sampling interval to one second. The drawback of this is that the hit testing for determining which pieces of media should go to which computers will become somewhat less accurate, and you might be missing some media for a few hundred milliseconds in on or more displays. In practice, this is quite unlikely to happen in most cases, and in case it does happen, it is quite likely to pass unnoticed.
